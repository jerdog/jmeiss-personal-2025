## The premise

I enjoy cooking. I grew up with a Mom who loved to cook, and learned from her Mom who did, who learned from her Mom.... You get the picture. I also love trying new things, and experimenting to see what comes out, which often means I see a recipe and use it as a "suggestion" to creating my own "recipe", which I of course will not write down. Oh, did I mention I have ADHD?  `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

Every year, the church we go to has a "Super Chili Bowl" where we play the Super Bowl on the big projector with the big sound system in the gymnatorium while kids can play and adults can watch, and then have it playing in smaller rooms for more intimate viewing, without the loud distractions from the kids playing and the adults watching. We also have a chili competition where anyone can bring their chili for judging and then eating, along with other potluck food and drink. I've competed a few times in the past, without winning anything. C'est La Vie.

This year, I decided I was going to win one of the categories, either in the "Non-Beef" or the "Most unique" categories. Since I love using my smoker, my plan was to smoke the chili, letting that smoke filter into the chili over ~4hrs while it cooked. So I went looking for some interesting recipes to give me some inspiration, and I finally settled on mixing a number of ideas together into one. But this time, I was going to write down what I did so I could hopefully do it again, with slight modifications, because my recipe is also a "suggestion".

## Getting Started

### The ingredients

1/2lb smoked country style ribs [pork butt] (from the day before)
3# smoked pork butt burnt ends (from the day before)


I got my smoker, a RecTec 590, turned on and set to 225F while I started to prepare the ingredients.
