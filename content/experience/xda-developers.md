description = "At XDA Developers, I served as the public face of the world's largest mobile online community, with over 7 million members. I managed and oversaw the News Portal, fostering engagement and delivering valuable content. My role involved building connections between OEMs and independent developers, as well as between developers and their users, to drive collaboration and innovation. I advocated for open-source practices within the mobile industry, including promoting license compliance with major OEMs like Sony, Samsung, and HTC. Additionally, I represented XDA at conferences and collaborated with teams to guide them in working effectively with the community to implement their software, hardware, or service products."
