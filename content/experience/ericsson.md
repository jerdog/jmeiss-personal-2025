description = "At Ericsson, I managed projects focused on delivering global business solutions that met customer requirements within agreed timelines. I facilitated results by leading collaborative sessions, meetings, and work sessions, serving as a liaison between customer business units, IT, and Ericsson resources to align efforts and accomplish shared objectives. I played a key role in driving the globalization of applications to support Ericsson resources worldwide, addressing the specific needs of the customer. Additionally, I delivered a SharePoint solution and oversaw daily status calls, providing VP-level reports during the user acceptance testing (UAT) phase of transitioning Ericsson employees off the Sprint network."
